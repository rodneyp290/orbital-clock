# Orbital clock
Clockface representing by earth orbiting sun.
- Earth's position represents the hour
- Moon's position relevant to the earth represents the minute

## Goal
Just something I wanted to do when bored

## Potential extensions
- AM/PM
  - Yellowly-Orange Sun for morning vs Red Sun Evening
- Seconds
 - Man made Satellite represented by blinking dot
 - Rocket
 - Non-sensical shadow - Day/Night cycle == 1 min
    - doesn't make sense as shadow doesn't move on Earth, Earth rotates
      - but this isn't a realistic simulation or anyway
